# Plagiarism Detector
---
#### ABSTRACT
In spite of years of effort, plagiarism in student assignment submissions still causes considerable difﬁculties for course designers; if students’ work is not their own, how can anyone be certain they have learnt anything.
Running-Karp-Rabin Greedy-String-Tiling (or RKS-GST), whose development arose from the observation that students shufﬂe independent code segments. It is able to detect transposed subsequences, and is less perturbed by spurious additional statements. Additionally , n-grams model for n=2 and n=3 is also being used for this purpose.A bigram or digram is a sequence of two adjacent elements from a string of tokens, which are typically letters, syllables, or words similarly a trigram is sequnce of three adjacent letters. A bigram is an n-gram for n=2 and a trigram is for n=3.

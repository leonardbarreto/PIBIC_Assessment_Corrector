Welcome to Plagiarism Detector's documentation!
===============================================
*In spite of years of effort, plagiarism in student assignment submissions still causes considerable difﬁculties for course designers; if students’ work is not their own, how can anyone be certain they have learnt anything.  Running-Karp-Rabin Greedy-String-Tiling (or RKS-GST), whose development arose from the observation that students shufﬂe independent code segments. It is able to detect transposed subsequences, and is less perturbed by spurious additional statements.* 


*In another part we use  concept of syntactic n-grams (sn-grams). Sn-grams differ from traditional n-grams in the manner how we construct them, i.e., what elements are considered neighbors. In case of sn grams, the neighbors are taken by following syntactic relations in syntactic trees, and not by taking words as they appear in a text, i.e., sn-grams are constructed by following paths in syntactic trees. In this manner, sn-grams allow bringing syntactic knowledge into machine learning methods; still, previous parsing is necessary for their construction.*
